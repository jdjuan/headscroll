  HeadScroll is mostly suited for <span class="bold">desktop devices</span>. Small devices might not offer the best experience. So we ask for your understanding.
  
  <!-- Simply tilt your head left or right, we'll take care of the rest.
  <span class="bold">For better results,</span> make sure the camera is right in front of you. -->
