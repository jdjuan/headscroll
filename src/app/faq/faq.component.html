      <h2 class="display-4 subtitle">How does it work?</h2>
      <p class="description">
        In plain English, I took about 5000 pictures and managed to teach a machine what a tilted head was, and what it was not. <br><br>
        In other words, I created a model using Google's <span class="bold">Teachable Machine</span>, put it on an Angular application, and scrolled a website every time the model told me there was a tilted head.
      </p>

      <h2 class="display-4 subtitle">What's on the roadmap?</h2>
      <p class="description">
        Taking a break, watching Netflix and playing videogames.<br /><br>
        But after that, I'm thinking of enabling HeadScroll as a native app (the kind you install in your computer) so that you can scroll
        any website without restrictions and with a better user experience.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2 class="display-4 subtitle">Is it open source?</h2>
      <p class="description">
        Yes! The code is available <a class="external-link" href="https://github.com/jdjuan/headscroll" target="_blank">here</a>. Contributions and issues are
        always welcomed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2 class="display-4 subtitle">Why can't you display certain websites?</h2>
      <p class="description">
        It's complicated.<br />
        I'm using an iframe to embed the websites and that already adds a lot of contraints. There's not even a reliable way to know if a website was displayed correctly other than user's feedback, so you can imagine.<br />
        That's why a native app would likely be the way to go.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2 class="display-4 subtitle">Who's behind this project?</h2>
      <p class="description">
        For legal matters, suits, or millionaire deals, it's just <a class="external-link" href="https://twitter.com/jdjuan" target="_blank">me</a>.<br>
        But HeadScroll wouldn't have been possible without the endless support of my family, my partner, and my friends. I also want to thank <span class="bold">you!</span> For motivating me to deliver when I first published a <a class="external-link" href="https://twitter.com/jdjuan/status/1330805748239097861" target="_blank">quick peak</a> of HeadScroll.
